## 🚀 About the Project

**Edu-Able** is an inclusive learning platform designed to make digital education genuinely accessible for students who are often underserved by conventional learning apps.

### Why this matters
Most platforms assume one learning style. Edu-Able challenges that by delivering multiple adaptive interfaces so students can learn in ways that match their cognitive and sensory needs.

### Problem we solve
- Learning tools that are visually dense and inaccessible
- Limited support for different disabilities in one platform
- Weak parent visibility into actual student progress

### Who it helps
- 🧒 Students with dyslexia, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and mixed learning needs  
- 👩‍🏫 Teachers who need inclusive digital resources  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parents monitoring progress and outcomes
